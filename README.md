# Agent Building Playbook

A **decision-first, research-baked kickstart** for building LLM agents — so the next
build starts with the right structure instead of refactoring into it.

> **The thesis** (worth internalizing): *"Most agent failures are orchestration
> failures, not model failures."* The model is one fallible component; reliability
> comes from the **harness** around it — tools, control flow, memory, verification,
> retries, evals, and a human in the loop where it matters. This kit is about that
> harness.

This is **vendor-neutral**. It leans on public authorities — Anthropic's
[Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents),
the [12-Factor Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents) methodology,
and the 2026 framework/eval/memory landscape — and uses **ClaimLens** (a 24-hour
hackathon project) as *one worked example*, including where it fell short. It is not
a pitch for any one tool or for ClaimLens.

## How to use it

1. **Before writing code**, run [`DECIDE-FIRST.md`](./DECIDE-FIRST.md) — the
   conversation to have *first*: how autonomous, which pattern, build-vs-reuse. Fill
   in the one-page spec at the bottom.
2. Pick your shape from [`PATTERNS.md`](./PATTERNS.md) (workflow patterns +
   closed-loop / DAG / self-healing / autonomous / human-in-the-loop).
3. Build against the eight competencies in [`PLAYBOOK.md`](./PLAYBOOK.md) — each with
   **practices**, **what to measure**, and **what to reuse instead of building**.
4. Don't reinvent: [`OSS-LANDSCAPE.md`](./OSS-LANDSCAPE.md) is the curated,
   source-cited map of frameworks/libraries per competency.
5. Gate yourself with [`CHECKLIST.md`](./CHECKLIST.md) before you call it done.

## What's here

| File | What it's for |
|---|---|
| [DECIDE-FIRST.md](./DECIDE-FIRST.md) | The pre-build decision framework + a fill-in spec. **Start here.** |
| [PATTERNS.md](./PATTERNS.md) | Agent shapes & when each fits (incl. closed-loop · DAG · self-healing · autonomous · HITL) |
| [PLAYBOOK.md](./PLAYBOOK.md) | The 8 competencies → practices · metrics · what to reuse |
| [OSS-LANDSCAPE.md](./OSS-LANDSCAPE.md) | Curated, cited frameworks/libraries — reuse, don't rebuild |
| [CHECKLIST.md](./CHECKLIST.md) | One-page pre-flight before shipping |
| [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) | Packaged as a Claude Code skill (open-source it as-is) |

## Open-sourcing this

Two equally valid forms (it's authored to be both):
- **As a process** — copy this folder into any repo; it's just Markdown.
- **As a skill** — [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md) is a ready Claude Code skill: drop the
  folder into `~/.claude/skills/agent-playbook/` (or a repo's `.claude/skills/`).

MIT licensed; attribute the cited sources. PRs that add measured data or new
patterns are the whole point.

## Related

- **[Multi-Agent Loop Kit](https://github.com/anshulixyz/multi-agent-loop-kit)** —
  a companion open-source project for running **multiple** coding/agent workers in a
  supervised loop (path ownership, task briefs, approval gates, journals). This
  playbook is the *"how to design one agent well"* layer; the Loop Kit is the
  *"how to coordinate many, safely"* layer. They pair naturally: decide the agent
  here, then scale it out there.

## The honest caveat (so this stays useful, not dogma)

No single pattern or tool is universally right — that's exactly why
[`DECIDE-FIRST.md`](./DECIDE-FIRST.md) exists. Treat every recommendation here as a
*default to argue with*, and replace claims with **your own measured numbers** as
soon as you have them. Where this kit cites a benchmark or a tool's positioning, the
source is linked; where it states our own experience, it's marked as such.
