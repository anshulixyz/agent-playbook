name: agent-playbook
description: >-
  Decision-first, vendor-neutral playbook for building LLM agents. Use when
  starting a new agent/agentic feature, scoping a hackathon agent build, choosing
  an autonomy level (workflow / human-in-the-loop / autonomous) or orchestration
  pattern (DAG, state machine, closed-loop, self-healing), deciding which agent
  framework/library to reuse vs build, or setting up agent evals, reliability,
  cost/latency, and human-in-the-loop. Triggers on "build an agent", "design an
  agent", "agentic workflow", "which agent framework", "agent evals", "how
  autonomous should this be".

# Agent Playbook (skill)

A kickstart for building reliable agents. Core thesis: **most agent failures are
orchestration failures, not model failures** — so spend your effort on the harness.

## How to drive this skill

When the user is about to build an agent (or asks how), do this in order — **don't
skip straight to code**:

1. **Decide first.** Walk the user through [`DECIDE-FIRST.md`](./DECIDE-FIRST.md):
   - Is this a **workflow** (code-orchestrated) or a **dynamic agent**?
   - **Autonomy level** — workflow / human-in-the-loop / supervised-autonomous /
     autonomous? Name the **HITL boundary** explicitly.
   - **Orchestration shape** from [`PATTERNS.md`](./PATTERNS.md) — pick the simplest
     that fits.
   - **Build vs reuse** per sub-system; consult [`OSS-LANDSCAPE.md`](./OSS-LANDSCAPE.md)
     and prefer reading a mature repo over a blank file.
   - Produce a filled `AGENT_SPEC.md` (template at the bottom of `DECIDE-FIRST.md`).
   **Ask the clarifying questions before proposing an architecture.**

2. **Build** against [`PLAYBOOK.md`](./PLAYBOOK.md) — the 8 competencies, each with
   practices, what to **measure**, and what to **reuse**.

3. **Prove + ship** using [`CHECKLIST.md`](./CHECKLIST.md). Especially: an eval set
   from day one (honest about small-n), **test at the real boundary** (HTTP/tool
   I/O, not just internals), CI gates, fail-closed outputs, and a written list of
   honest limits.

## Rules this skill enforces
- **Simplest thing that works first** — add agency/complexity only when deterministic
  workflows fall short (Anthropic).
- **HITL is a design choice, decided up front** — and "escalate to human" is a
  first-class output, never a failure.
- **Reuse the hard sub-systems** (memory, evals/tracing, durable execution, HITL);
  build only the thin domain glue.
- **Honesty over headline numbers** — report variance, small-n, and what's thin.
- **No secrets in artifacts**; **scoped commits**; **keep a decision trail**.
